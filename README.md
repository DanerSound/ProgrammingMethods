# ProgrammingMethods

This Repo i'll contain all my exercises for this course following as much as possible the TDD approach .

exercise 0 ["I'll not write bad code"](https://github.com/DanerSound/ProgrammingMethods/blob/master/ProgrammingMethods/src/main/java/base/BadCode.java) :  This exercise is a simple test of a method that control the correctness of an given String.


_You have to focues in that both Strings ( testString and returnedString )_ **must** _be the same_ .
 
 
 exercise 1 ["My expression analysis"](https://github.com/DanerSound/ProgrammingMethods/tree/myExpressionAnalysis) : This is an introduction exercise for the design pattern [Composite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern) :
 
 
 exercise 2 ["Shape TDD"](https://github.com/DanerSound/ProgrammingMethods/tree/ShapeTDD) : i try to implement a generic scheme to generate geometric figures
 
exercise 3 ["Fragile base class problem"](https://github.com/DanerSound/ProgrammingMethods/tree/fragile_base_class_Problem) : This is an inherent problem of Inheritance between classes.
The problem comes out when the methods of the Base class are _"in relation to each other"_ and the classes that have inherited those methods of the Base class overwrite some of methods.

//TODO ADD UML
